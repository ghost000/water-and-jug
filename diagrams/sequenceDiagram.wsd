' User creates the solver and passes the jug capacities
User -> Main: Create Solver
Main -> Solver: setJugs(jugCapacities)
Solver -> Validator: validateJugs(jugCapacities)
Validator --> Solver: validation result

' User requests the solver to solve the problem for a given water amount
Main -> Solver: solve(targetAmount)
Solver -> Validator: canReachTarget(targetAmount, jugCapacities)
Validator --> Solver: target reachable?

' Solver starts BFS algorithm to find the solution
Solver -> Solver: BFS algorithm to find solution

' Solver returns solution steps
Solver --> Main: Return solution steps
